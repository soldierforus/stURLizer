## About
Tired of sharing unnecessarily long links?  Practice good digital hygiene and stop sharing links with tracking parameters in the URL!   With the stURLize extension, you can copy a clean URL to your clipboard in a single click!

Many sites pass data to each other using URL, or query, parameters.  When you click a link you may be unknowingly passing data about yourself or your visits to and from sites.  These parameters are sometimes used to specify and sort content on a web page, but they are also used for traffic tracking.

This app allows you to copy the page URL without parameters, so you can share links freely without being fingerprinted.  It also allows you to click links on a page and open the sterile URL in a new tab.  

Works with facebook!  Right click a post and opening in a new tab using stURLizer bypasses facebook's redirect.
